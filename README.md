# SMS_Notification_API
A form integrated with the Twilio SMS API to test the API

The Twilio API works with the composer sdk. You can search 'twilio php' to get a link to instructions on how to install composer.
Please be mindful of where the composer files are stored after install. Ideally, the files should be installed in the same folder running the
application or website.

Please delete the composer.lock file and the composer.json file in this folder. Those files will be downloaded in your folder during the composer installation.

Sign up for a Twilio account to get the authentication key and the sid key for this to work.

I hope this helps.
